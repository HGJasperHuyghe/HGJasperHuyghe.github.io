    <p>It all began when Jan-LÃ©onard Moortgat and his wife founded the Moortgat brewery farm in 1871. Around the turn of the century, Moortgat was one of the over 3,000 breweries operating in Belgium.

        Jan-Leonard experimented by trial and error, and his top-fermented beers were soon greatly appreciated in the brewery's home town of Puurs and far beyond. Before long, the Brussels bourgeoisie was also won over by his beers.
